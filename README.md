# Delta Flight Delay Analysis (2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Delta Air Lines’ 2024 flight data to identify delay patterns, improve reliability, and support operations decision-making. It demonstrates skills in **SQL data wrangling** and **Tableau dashboard development**, aligned with data wrangler / business analyst roles.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL: Joins, aggregations, calculated columns, reliability measures
- Data Wrangling: Cleaning, transforming, and enriching raw data
- Tableau: Interactive dashboard design with KPIs, filters, and drill-downs
- Storytelling: Turning data into actionable insights for airline operations

## 🗄️ Files in this Repo
-  DeltaStory copy.sql.zip → MySQL queries for cleaning and analyzing flight data
- `tableau/dashboard_link.txt` → direct link to Tableau Public dashboard
- `screenshots/` → dashboard preview images
- `README.md` → project documentation

## ⚙️ How to Use
### SQL
1. Open `sql/delta_flight_delays.sql` in **MySQL Workbench** (or any MySQL client).
2. Run queries step by step to explore:
   - Delay causes (% events, % minutes)
   - Reliability calculations
   - Enriched views (`delta_enriched`) with hub flags and on-time performance

### Tableau
- Dashboard is fully interactive on Tableau Public.
- No Tableau Desktop license required to view.

## 🚀 Insights
- Identified top delay contributors (carrier vs. weather vs. NAS).
- Measured on-time rates by hub and month.
- Created enriched dataset for **operations managers** to make staffing and scheduling decisions.

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This project shows my ability to wrangle real-world datasets, design data pipelines, and deliver insights through visual analytics — skills directly relevant to data analyst / data wrangler roles.
